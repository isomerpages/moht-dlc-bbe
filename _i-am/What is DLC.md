# Digital Local Connect DLC
Q1. What is DLC?
DLC is a one-stop pocket guide that contains: 
* A list of curated and relevant agencies in the precinct - so that you know who are your partners, what services/ support do they provide, and how to link up with when you require assistance 
* Training guides & resources - to support your continuous re-learning 
* Support network - a closed-group communication channel to enable sharing of best practices 

DLC is a curated list of support for partners working in the same precinct (e.g. Clementi). 

Q2. Why did MOHT develop DLC?
The Integrated Health Promotion team within MOHT (or in short, MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation) observed the following gaps in the community: 
* Community partners do not know the exact services available and are not sure who to work with when help is needed. 
* Volunteers have problems identifying and escalating needy cases for further support
* There is no one communication platform for all providers to learn from one another. 

As such, the DLC was developed to address the above needs.
