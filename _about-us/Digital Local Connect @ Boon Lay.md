![cewgfwf](/images/untitled%20design%20(1).png)


A one-stop library containing information about the neighbourhood for precinct leaders (GRAs and team), volunteers, and other community stakeholders (Doctors and teachers etc) in Boon Lay to help guide residents to the relevant services, programmes, and resources so they can seek the help they need. **For example, local GPs can use  DLC to find a nearby fitness programme when recommending a healthier lifestyle for a resident.**
